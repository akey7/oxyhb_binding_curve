# oxyhb_binding_curve
Calculates oxyHb binding curves as described in the supplement as found in Dash et al. (citation at bottom).

## Conda virtual environment

You can manage the dependencies with conda.

```
conda create -n oxyhb_binding_curve python=3.11
conda install numpy matplotlib jupyterlab
```

If you wish, you can use `pip` as well.

## Usage

The main source file is `oxyhb_binding_curve.py`. It contains a class called `OxyHbBindingCurve` that calculates binding curves based on the equations on page 8 of the supplement of the cited paper. The notebook `plot_binding_curves.ipynb` uses that class to plot binding curves.
